        <h2>Why we exist</h2>
        <p>Australia has long had foster homes for people, cats, dogs and wildlife. We thought <em>“Why not farmed animals too?”</em>. Today ‘Til The Cows Come Home is Australia’s leading online adoption agency for farmed animals. We have foster carers across Australia enabling adopters to turn their homes into forever homes for these deserving souls. From ducks to camels, feather, fur or skin we help them all. </p>

      <section id="our-goal">
        <h2>Our goal</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to save unwanted farmed animals by working directly with farmers and families to rehome them into loving, forever homes. Our sophisticated adoption process and foster care program together make for a world where people are progressively viewing farmed animals with the same warmth, and to offer the same rights, afforded to domestic pets.</p>
        <p><strong>Every life that TTCCH touches, we change their world forever.</strong></p>
