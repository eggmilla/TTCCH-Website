  I took inspiration from government sites such as <a href="https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/">my aged care</a> and <a href="https://www.ombudsman.vic.gov.au/complaints/make-complaint/">Victoria's ombudsman</a> as they are rated as highly accessible. Drawing upon their similarities, I discoverd that they:
  <ul> 
    <li>use colour blocking</li>
    <li>have lots of white space</li>
    <li>use only one typeface with different weights and sizes</li>
    <li>have links or buttons to reveal more information</li>
  </ul> 
  I wanted to take these into account when creating my own website in order to be more inclusive. The initial changes I made were: 
  <ul>
    <li>using two typefaces</li>
    <li>not using a cow print pattern background as it could be very distracting even if static</li>
    <li>creating obvious hover states for all links - used underline and colour change for text</li>
    <li>utilising white space</li>
  </ul>
</p> 
<p> From retail sites I saw the use of animation and call-to-actions and was inspired to possibly include some of these on my site. I included a 'donate now' button on the landing page as the header doesn't feature an explicit 'donate' page. 
</p>
<p> Further, when performing casual user feedback I was told: 

</p>
<p>
And in combination with this feedback and reflecting on my site's main purpose, I made further changes:
<ul>
  <li>having a slightly see-through hero textbox</li>
  <li>used only one typeface to keep content looking consistent</li>
  <li>using round borders on images to create more white space</li>
  <li>pushing all the social media links in the footer to one side for convenience and better spacing</li>
  <li>creating a thinner footer to not "squash" the page when both header and footer are visible</li>
  <li>dimming images to brighten them when hovered over for obvious image hover states</li>
  <li>having a consistent look for all images (which are also links) - round, dimmed and with caption underneath</li> 
  <li>omitted the "learn more" shortcut image frmo the landing page as it wouldn't be considered on the main purposes of the site and it is featured in the header</li> 
</ul>
</p>
