        <h2>Save A Life - Donate Now</h2>
        <p>Every year, millions of unwanted farmed animals suffer an unimaginable fate. These are the forgotten ones. No-one hears their cries.</p> 
        <p>Most are deemed a waste product of the dairy industry, others are used as egg-laying machines their entire short life, never seeing natural daylight or feeling the sunshine on their feathers.</p> 
        <p>You can help save and re-home unwanted farmed animals. Their lives are in your hands. No task is too great for our dedicated team. Our extraordinary volunteers are on the frontline every day, facing new challenges and the sad reality of animal neglect. YOU can be there with them by donating now.</p>

        <h2>Leave a Lasting Legacy</h2>
        <p>Farm animals like cows, pigs, chickens and sheep are not protected under any animal cruelty laws. We strive for a world where people view farmed animals with the same warmth, and offer the same rights afforded to domestic pets. Thanks to people like you, we can continue with our mission and in doing so we can facilitate more surrendered animals, open more holding stations, cover vet care costs, purchase feed and upgrade our transport options.</p>
        <p>No matter the donation or amount you are able to give, we are always grateful for those who support our mission. If you leave a gift to Til the Cows Come Home in your Will, we will give you regular updates into our mission and plans for the future and how your gift will help us achieve them.</p>
